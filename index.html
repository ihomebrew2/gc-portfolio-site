		<p> Hello! Welcome to my first ever web page!!</P>
		
		<p>My name is Jim Riley. I have been married for 15 years to my wonderful wife
		Sarah. We have four children; Kaitlin, Gretchen, James, and Bella, as well as a
		German Shepard named Luna. We enjoy hiking, camping, and road-tripping as a family.
		We have been on many wonderful adventures across the country, spanning from Rocky 
		Mountain NP in Colorado to Acadia NP in Maine.</p>
		
		<p>I've had many different jobs over the years and the one thing I feel they have all
		lacked is mobility, both in the physical sense and also the way my creativity and 
		aspirations have been limited. My hope is that the part-time front end coding boot camp 
		will provide me with new options to confront both of the mobility issues that I face.</p>
